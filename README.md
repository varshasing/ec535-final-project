This project presents a browser-based remote control system for the HiWonder PuppyPi, a quadruped robot that integrates both live video streaming and sensor-based safety mechanisms. Utilizing manufacturer-specific Python libraries for precise control of servomotors and behavior sequencing, the system enables users to command the robot via keyboard inputs and UI buttons through a React frontend. Real-time feedback is achieved through an onboard USB camera streamed with MJPG-Streamer, while a LiDAR sensor continuously monitors the environment to override potentially unsafe movement commands. By combining vendor-specific APIs with a modular web-based interface and WebSocket communication, this project demonstrates how accessible and reactive robotics can be achieved even with hardware constraints, with applications in education, teleoperation, and autonomous exploration.
